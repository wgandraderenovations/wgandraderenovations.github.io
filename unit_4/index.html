<h2>Company</h2>
<p>Our history begins in 2000, when the Owner/Director Ezequiel Andrade retired. Ezequiel worked in a Global organisation for 38 years as a Civil Engineer. Just right after his last day working as an employee he decided to be an employer, hence WGAndrade Renovations started. 
Today, Ezequiel employs 10 employees and a number of indirect contractors.</p>
